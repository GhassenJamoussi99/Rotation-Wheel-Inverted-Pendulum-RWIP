# Proof of Concept - Sensor Implementation

This README file provides an overview of the proof of concept (POC) implementation of sensors, specifically the encoder and gyroscope. Please note that this POC was conducted during the M2 phase of the project and is no longer actively maintained. However, it is still valuable to have an understanding of the initial implementation of these sensors.

## Sensor POC Description

The POC focused on integrating and testing the functionality of the encoder and gyroscope sensors within the project. Here is a brief description of each sensor:

1. **Encoder Sensor:** The encoder sensor (AMT103) is used to measure the rotation or position of a wheel or motor shaft. It provides data on the number of rotations or the angle of rotation, which can be used for various purposes such as tracking the movement of a vehicle or controlling motor speed.

2. **Gyroscope Sensor:** The gyroscope sensor (MPU6050) measures the angular velocity or rate of rotation around various axes. It provides information on the orientation and movement of an object. In the context of this project, the gyroscope data can be utilized for detecting changes in the vehicle's orientation or detecting sudden movements.
